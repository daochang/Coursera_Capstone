    "__Introduction__ \n",
    "\n",
    "Singapore is a small nation-state in South-east Asia, with a population of about 5 million people. Its education system ranks among the best in the world, where its students consistently come in among the top few worldwide in PISA scores. A good education is highly prized for it brings promise of a stable, high-paying job in the future. Hence, a place in the popular \"top\" schools is highly sought after, right down to primary (elementary) school. Good foundations pave the way for good test scores for entry into the best schools in the next level of the education system, so goes the general thinking. \n",
    "\n",
    "Practically every Singaporean parent with school-going children knows the game. The popular \"top\" schools are household names too. Some schools are also known for being the best at certain sports or competitive games. Based on performance in preliminary exams sat for in the final year of elementary and high school, each student roughly knows what \"tier\" of schools he/she can enter in the next level of the system. Grades are make or break, literally. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, basing a major decision on just 1 factor is a little shoddy and boring, isn't it? What about life outside school? Where can a student hang out with friends or go on a date after school? What are the lunch options available? For the tiger moms/dads out there - are there entertainment options aplenty nearby that might distract their children from going straight home for yet more study and revision?\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I will put aside test scores and \"top schools\", and explore the neighbourhoods of schools in Singapore to identify various groups of schools that might cater to different profiles of students and their parents."
